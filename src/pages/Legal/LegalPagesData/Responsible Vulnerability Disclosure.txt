Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure
Introduction
At DeepTrust AI, we take the security of our platform and customer data seriously. We recognize the important role that independent security researchers and the community play in identifying vulnerabilities. If you discover a potential issue, we ask that you help us protect our users by following this Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
By reporting security concerns responsibly, you are helping us maintain the trust and safety of our customers and their data.
________________


How to Report a Vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in DeepTrust AI:
1. Email us at: security@mydeeptrust.ai

2. Include as much detail as possible, including:

   * Steps to reproduce the issue

   * The affected system or feature

   * Any proof-of-concept code, if applicable

   * Your contact information so we can follow up

________________


What to Avoid
To protect our customers and systems, please:
      * Do not attempt to access, modify, or delete data that does not belong to you.

      * Do not use automated scanners that generate significant traffic or impact service availability.

      * Do not conduct denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, social engineering, or phishing against our employees, contractors, or customers.

      * Do not publicly disclose details of the vulnerability until we have confirmed and remediated the issue.

________________


Our Commitment to You
When you report a vulnerability in good faith and in compliance with this policy:
         * We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 72 hours.

         * We will investigate and validate the issue as quickly as possible.

         * We will keep you informed of our progress and the status of your report.

         * Once resolved, we may credit you for the discovery if you wish to be recognized.

         * We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow this policy.

Safe Harbor
DeepTrust AI commits to:
            * Not initiating legal action against security researchers who act in good faith and comply with this policy.

            * Considering security research conducted under this policy as authorized access under applicable anti-hacking laws.

            * Treating research findings as confidential until both parties agree that disclosure is safe.

________________


Scope
This policy applies to:
               * DeepTrust AI web applications hosted under mydeeptrust.ai.

               * DeepTrust AI APIs and related services.

               * Mobile apps (when applicable).

Out of scope:
                  * Third-party services or platforms not owned by DeepTrust AI (though we encourage responsible disclosure directly to those vendors).

Bug Bounty Roadmap
Introduction
At DeepTrust AI, security is fundamental to trust. While we currently operate a Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure Program, we recognize the value of evolving this into a formal Bug Bounty Program to further engage the global security research community.
Our roadmap ensures that as we grow, we continue to meet the highest standards of security and accountability.
________________


Current Phase: Responsible Disclosure
                     * Vulnerabilities can be reported to security@mydeeptrust.ai.

                     * We acknowledge reports within 72 hours.

                     * Valid issues are prioritized, investigated, and remediated quickly.

                     * Safe Harbor protection applies to all researchers who act in good faith.

                     * Recognition may be offered on our website or in release notes.

________________


Next Phase: Private Pilot Bug Bounty Program (Planned)
We plan to launch an invite-only bug bounty program with trusted security researchers.
                        * Participants will receive structured scope documentation.

                        * Valid submissions may be eligible for monetary rewards.

                        * The pilot will help us refine severity ratings, triage processes, and payout structures.

________________


Future Phase: Public Bug Bounty Program (Long-Term Goal)
Once the private program is mature, we intend to open the DeepTrust AI Bug Bounty Program to the broader research community.
                           * Public scope will include apps, APIs, and integrations.

                           * Reward tiers will be based on severity and impact.

                           * Transparency reports will be published annually, highlighting issues discovered and resolved.

________________


Timeline
                              * 2025: Responsible Disclosure live (current phase).

                              * 2026: Launch Private Bug Bounty Pilot (invite-only).

                              * 2027: Expand to a Public Bug Bounty Program.

These dates may evolve as we scale, but security will remain central to our roadmap.
________________


Researcher Recognition
We deeply value the contributions of ethical security researchers. As our Bug Bounty Program evolves, we will create:
                                 * Hall of Fame: Public recognition of top contributors (opt-in).

                                 * Reward System: Monetary compensation tied to severity ratings (CVSS-based).

                                 * Community Engagement: Ongoing collaboration with researchers worldwide.
