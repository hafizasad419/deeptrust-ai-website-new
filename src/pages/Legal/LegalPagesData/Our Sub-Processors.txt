Our Sub-Processors
Introduction
To provide DeepTrust AI, we rely on carefully selected third-party service providers (“Sub-Processors”). These providers help us deliver secure, scalable, and reliable services while meeting enterprise expectations for privacy and security.
We recognize that when you entrust DeepTrust AI with your data, you also entrust the providers we use. That’s why every Sub-Processor is vetted for security and compliance before engagement.
________________


Our Practices
* Strict Standards: We only engage Sub-Processors who meet rigorous data protection, confidentiality, and security requirements.

* Written Agreements: All Sub-Processors are bound by contracts that meet or exceed our own data protection obligations under GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, and other global privacy frameworks.

* Transparency: We maintain a list of all active Sub-Processors and will provide it upon request.

* Change Notification: Customers may request to be notified of new Sub-Processors and object to material changes within 30 days.
